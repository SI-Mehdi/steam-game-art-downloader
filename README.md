# Steam Art Downloader
Python script to download Steam art for games. This is particularly useful for adding non-Steam games to Steam as these will require art to be provided manually

# Instructions

Clone the repository and create a file called ```constants.py``` at the root

In this file add a variable for your SteamGridDB API key like so:
``` 
api_key = # YOUR API KEY HERE #
```
Then simply run the script in your terminal:

```
python grid_download.py
```
