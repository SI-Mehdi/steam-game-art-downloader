# Steam Art Downloader
Python script to download Steam art for games. This is particularly useful for adding non-Steam games to Steam as these will require art to be provided manually

In this file add a variable for your SteamGridDB API key like so:
``` 
api_key = # YOUR API KEY HERE #
```
To get your API key, log in to SteamGridDB with and go to the Preferences page of your profile and select the API tab

Then simply run the script in your terminal:

```
python art_download.py
```
